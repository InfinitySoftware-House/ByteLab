Hi, I’m **Francesco**, and welcome to **ByteLab**!

I’m currently studying **Information Technology (IT)** at university, where I’m diving deep into the world of software development, systems engineering, and data science. As someone who’s passionate about both **technology** and **investing**, I decided to create ByteLab as a space to document my journey and share what I’m learning.

## My Journey So Far

Since starting my studies in IT, I’ve been fascinated by how technology can solve complex problems and improve our daily lives. From coding small programs to working on larger projects, I’m always excited to explore new tools, frameworks, and solutions. 

On top of my academic journey, I’ve also developed a growing interest in **investments**—particularly how technology is transforming financial markets. As I learn about investing in areas like **stocks** and **ETF**, I document my insights here on ByteLab. This allows me to connect my passion for both **code** and **investments**, sharing my experiences and lessons learned along the way.

## What You'll Find on ByteLab

At ByteLab, I write about:

- **IT Projects**: Tutorials, coding experiments, and case studies from my personal projects and coursework.
- **Investment Strategies**: My thoughts on investing, particularly in tech-related markets, with updates on my own portfolio and learning experiences.
- **Problem-Solving**: Challenges I encounter in both university studies and coding, along with solutions I discover.
- **Learning Journey**: Insights into new technologies and trends I’m exploring, both academically and in my personal development.

## Outside of IT and Investments

When I’m not coding or studying, I enjoy staying updated on the latest tech trends, experimenting with new tools, and diving into finance and economic news. I also like collaborating with other tech enthusiasts and developers, so feel free to reach out if you share similar interests!
