This week has been an exciting one for my portfolio! I saw positive movement across multiple assets, and I’m excited to share the results with you.

## Background

I started investing from January 2024 a low amount of money, and after a few months, I have managed to increase my monthly contributions. I have been investing in **FTSE All-World USD (Acc)** and **S&P 500 Information Tech USD (Acc)** ETFs, which have been performing well.

In addition, I have also invested in individual stocks, like _Apple_, using **Round-Ups** and **Savebacks** from my daily transactions, and _Amazon_ using **Invite a Friend** rewards.

## Portfolio Overview

| Metric                    | Value     |
|---------------------------|-----------|
| **Total Investment Value**| €628.12   |
| **Weekly Change**         | <span style="color: green;">+3.26%</span> |

## Assets Performance

| Asset                          | My Investment | Asset Value | Weekly Change |
|--------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **FTSE All-World USD (Acc)**   | €463.38       | €129.22       | <span style="color: green;">+2.64%</span> |
| **S&P 500 Information Tech USD (Acc)** | €104.10 | €30.53        | <span style="color: green;">+5.37%</span> |
| **Apple**                      | €38.35        | €211.50       | <span style="color: green;">+4.96%</span> |
| **Amazon**                     | €22.17        | €171.72       | <span style="color: green;">+4.48%</span> |

The FTSE All-World USD (Acc) has been steadily climbing, posting a **2.64%** gain this week. It’s a solid performer, and I’m optimistic about its continued upward trend.

The S&P 500 Information Tech USD (Acc) was the star performer, with an impressive **5.37%** growth. Tech stocks have been on a roll, and this ETF reflects that trend.

Apple also had a strong week, increasing by **4.96%**. The stock's steady rise adds solid value to the portfolio.

Lastly, Amazon grew by **4.48%**, reinforcing its position as a key player in my portfolio.

Overall, I’m really pleased with how my investments performed this week. The tech sector, in particular, has been driving significant growth in my portfolio, and I’m excited to see where things go from here!
