# FLUX.1 Models: Unveiling Powerful Image Generation

Today, I’m excited to share one of the best **Stable Diffusion Models** I’ve been working with—**FLUX.1**. This model stands out as a powerful tool for generating stunning, high-quality images.

## What is FLUX.1?

Developed by **Black Forest Labs**, FLUX.1 is a series of **cutting-edge generative deep learning models** built on the foundation of **stable diffusion**. The model excels in delivering high-quality images with remarkable speed. Among the FLUX series, **FLUX.1 [Dev]** strikes a balance between image quality and inference speed, making it an ideal option for many projects.

Here’s a quick overview of the FLUX.1 models:

| Model            | Description                                                     | Availability                  |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| FLUX.1 [Schnell] | Fastest inference, lower quality. Optimized with step-distillation. | Available for download         |
| FLUX.1 [Dev]     | Balanced speed and quality. Utilizes guidance-distillation.        | Available for download         |
| FLUX.1 [Pro]     | Slower but high-quality output.                                   | API only                      |
| FLUX 1.1 [Pro]   | Best quality with improved speed over FLUX.1 [Pro].               | API only                      |

## Local Testing with FLUX.1 [Dev]

Personally, I’ve been using **FLUX.1 [Dev]** alongside [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) to generate images directly on my desktop. To handle the model more efficiently on my hardware (**NVIDIA 1660 Super 6GB**), I use a **4-bit quantized version** of FLUX.1 [Dev], which significantly speeds up inference time. The full model is quite resource-intensive, so if you’re running a more powerful GPU (such as an **RTX 4080/4090**), you’ll be able to unlock its full potential and achieve the best quality output.

On my system, generating an image at **1024x1024** resolution with **28 steps** takes around **6 minutes**. While it’s not the fastest, the results are well worth the wait for my projects.

## FLUX.1 via the Cloud: BFL API

If you prefer to offload the heavy processing, **Black Forest Labs** offers an easy-to-use [API](https://docs.bfl.ml/) that allows you to generate images in the cloud with any FLUX.1 model. The pricing model is flexible, charging only for what you use.

### BFL API Pricing

| Model           | Price per Image |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| FLUX 1.1 [Pro]  | $0.04           |
| FLUX.1 [Pro]    | $0.05           |
| FLUX.1 [Dev]    | $0.025          |

Using the API is straightforward, allowing you to generate high-quality images quickly, without worrying about hardware limitations.
